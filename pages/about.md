## About the Collection

This collection contains scans of songbook covers from 1909-1927. They have been sourced from the personal collection of Josie Shephard (learn more in the Creator and Support); the books have been gathered over several years from various thrift stores, and many vintage markets and stores. This collection was designed to showcase popular song titles from the early 1900â€™s. 

The songbooks featured on this site were songs popular in the United States during their printing. Many of the songs contain themes of love, a common song topic; there are some in the collection that focus on other topics, such as World War One and break-ups. Some of the songbooks in the collection are considered humorous songs due to their joking lyrics and unserious topics. Some of the songs in the collection come from stage shows that were popular at the time while others come from radio and dance clubs.  Many of the songs fall into the main genre of popular music while touching on other genres such as Jazz and Ragtime. 

These books were designed to be purchased by Comsumers to then be used and sang at home. This collection does not showcase the songs themselves but is instead meant to display the artistic covers of the books. Songbooks from these years were often printed multiple times with different covers each time; this collection seeks to preserve one version of some of the covers. This collection also seeks to provide information about popular composers, lyricists and publishers of these songbooks and enter their names into the public record.  

This project was created for Z652: Digital Libraries with Instructor Jon Walsh and Associate Instructor Gyuri Kang in the fall of 2024.
